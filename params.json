{"name":"Digital Emulation of a Vacuum Tube Guitar Preamp","tagline":"Final Project for EECS 352 at Northwestern University","body":"### Introduction\r\nVacuum tube guitar amplifiers are niche musical products which generate millions of dollars in annual sales. Vacuum tubes are an otherwise obsolete technology that is still being used in guitar amplifiers today because many electric guitarists prefer the way they distort and respond to playing dynamics compared to transistor amplifiers. The main reason why tubes sound different when they distort is the way they clip the signal, soft clipping the signal waveform instead of abruptly hard clipping (see figure below). \r\n\r\n![figure1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ArthurMa/EECS352/master/figure1.jpg)\r\nDigital modeling amplifiers already exist, but to many electric guitarists, they often fall short of capturing the unique sound of an overdriven tube amplifier. Our goal was to create an algorithm ableto emulate the cascaded soft clipping present in guitar vacuum tube preamps, given a suitable electric guitar signal encoded in an audio format.\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out the documentation at https://help.github.com/pages or contact support@github.com and weâ€™ll help you sort it out.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
